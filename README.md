## Description
Forked​ ​a​ ​version​ ​of​ ​(https://thingsboard.io/)​ ​and​ ​(https://github.com/thingsboard/thingsboard)
application​ ​and​ ​create​ ​a​ ​Rule​ ​Action​ ​that​ ​is​ ​able​ ​to​ ​send​ ​a​ ​transaction​ ​to​ ​kovan​ ​testnet.
The​ ​outcome​ ​will​ ​be​ ​a​ ​deployed​ ​web​ ​IoT​ ​application​ ​system​ ​with​ ​integration​ ​with
Ethereum​ ​blockchain.

Thingsboard is an IoT framework that can assimilate IoT Sensor and Actuator data to support a
number of use cases. This application can for a basis for a reference application to generate
linkage between IoT and Blockchain ecosystems.
The platform is open source and can be forked to create a changes on top of its framework. It
needs understanding of the java and spring technology to deploy and work with this platform. It
has a Rule framework that allows a developer to generate IoT sensor data driven events.
You should have understanding of the java and spring ecosystem to be
able to work with this platform.
